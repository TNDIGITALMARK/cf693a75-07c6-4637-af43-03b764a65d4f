- Social sharing functionality
- Play again and return to menu options
- Leaderboard display

### 3. Design System ✅

**Visual Styling** (`src/app/globals.css`)

### 4. Features Implemented ✅

**Gameplay Mechanics**
- Pac-Man movement with directional buffering
- Dot collection (10 points each)

- Power mode with 10-second timer
- Lives system (3 lives)
- Level progression with difficulty scaling
- High score persistence in localStorage

**Ghost AI Behaviors**
- Blinky (Red): Direct pursuit of Pac-Man

- Inky (Cyan): Complex targeting with Blinky reference
- Clyde (Orange): Shy behavior (far = chase, close = scatter)
- Mode switching: Chase → Scatter → Chase (timed cycles)
- Frightened mode when power pellet eaten
- Eaten mode returns ghosts to ghost house

**Responsive Design**

- Type-safe TypeScript throughout
- Modular file structure
- Reusable utility functions
- Well-documented code

**Performance**
- Efficient canvas rendering
- RequestAnimationFrame game loop
- Optimized collision detection
- Minimal re-renders
- Proper cleanup of event listeners

**Best Practices**
- Client-side rendering for browser APIs
- Proper React hooks usage
- Ref-based game state for performance
- Error boundaries ready
- Mobile-first responsive design

## 🎮 How to Play
